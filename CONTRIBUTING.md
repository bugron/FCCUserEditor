## Contribution Guidelines

1.  Fork the project: [How to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2.  Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work to that branch. ([Need help with branching?](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)).
3.  Name the branch something like `fix/xxx` or `feature/xxx` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are attempting to add. For example `fix/api-deleteuser` would be a branch where I fix something specific to `/deleteuser` API.
4.  You should have [ESLint running in your editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations.html), and it will highlight anything doesn't conform to [Free Code Camp's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Free-Code-Camp-JavaScript-Style-Guide) (you can find a summary of those rules [here](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/.eslintrc). Please do not ignore any linting errors, as they are meant to **help** you and to ensure a clean and simple code base. Make sure none of your JavaScript is longer than 80 characters per line.
5.  Squash your Commits. Ref: [squashing you commits](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one).
6.  Once your code is ready, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your branch to FCCUserEditor's `master` branch. I'll do a quick code review and give you feedback, then iterate from there.
